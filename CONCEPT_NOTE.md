### Crowdfunded Adaptive Disaster Relief Streaming

---

## 1. Overview

AnticiPay is a programmable humanitarian finance system that delivers **adaptive basic income as a continuous stream**, automatically increasing support when disaster risks are forecast or confirmed. Instead of sending aid only after crises occur, AnticiPay anticipates shocks and ensures that financial support flows **before, during, and after disasters**.

AnticiPay combines **crowdfunded treasuries, money streaming, anticipatory action, and Layer-2 payment networks** to transform humanitarian cash assistance into a living financial safety net.

AnticiPay shifts humanitarian aid from reactive payments to **predictive, continuous, and dignified support**.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Traditional disaster relief and cash assistance systems are:

* Reactive rather than preventive
* Delivered in delayed lump-sum payments
* Operationally expensive on blockchains
* Dependent on manual approvals
* Inefficient for micro-transactions

People often receive help **after assets are lost and livelihoods disrupted**, even though climate and risk data already indicate where and when disasters will strike.

There is a growing need for a system that can:

* Anticipate risk,
* Mobilize funds early,
* Deliver support continuously, and
* Scale affordably.

---

## 3. Solution: AnticiPay

AnticiPay introduces **Adaptive UBI Streaming for Disaster Resilience**.

Each household enrolled in AnticiPay receives a **base income stream** funded by a shared treasury. Funds flow continuously rather than in one-time transfers. When disaster risk increases, AnticiPay automatically **boosts the streaming rate** based on forecast signals and on-the-ground confirmations.

At the same time, AnticiPay allows the treasury itself to be **crowdfunded by the public, institutions, and partners**, making resilience a participatory and transparent process.

In simple terms:

> AnticiPay lets money flow all the time — and flow faster when people need it most.

## 4. Core Components

### 4.1 Crowdfunded Treasury

AnticiPay operates a shared treasury that:

* Accepts public and institutional contributions.
* Pools funds transparently.
* Provides liquidity for streaming payments.
* Calculates sustainable payout rates based on treasury health.

Donors can contribute to specific regions, hazards, or programs and observe real-time impact through dashboards.

The treasury becomes a **living pool of resilience capital**, not a static donation pot.

### 4.2 Adaptive UBI Streaming

Instead of lump-sum aid, AnticiPay streams funds continuously.

Each beneficiary has:

* A base stream rate (UBI).
* Automatic rate adjustments during risk events.
* On-demand withdrawals through apps, IVR, POS, or merchants.

Example logic:

| Condition          | Multiplier |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| Normal             | 1.0×       |
| Forecast Alert     | 1.5×       |
| Warning            | 2.0×       |
| Confirmed Disaster | 3.0×       |
| Recovery           | 1.2×       |

This ensures that support increases **before evacuation, before asset loss, and before livelihoods collapse**.

---

### 4.3 Anticipatory Trigger Engine

AnticiPay integrates with:

* Weather forecasts
* Climate risk models
* Local sensors and reports
* Inspector validations

These feeds activate programmable rules that adjust streaming rates automatically. Human operators remain in the loop for safety, but the system reduces delays by making risk actionable.

---

### 4.4 Layer-2 Streaming via Yellow Network

Frequent micro-payments are expensive on-chain. AnticiPay uses Layer-2 state channels such as **Yellow Network** to:

* Enable gasless, instant balance updates.
* Support continuous streaming logic off-chain.
* Batch settlement only when necessary.
* Deliver Web2-like UX with Web3 security.

This allows AnticiPay to scale to thousands of beneficiaries without blockchain congestion.


## 5. How AnticiPay Works

1. Donors and partners fund the AnticiPay Treasury.
2. Program Manager enrolls beneficiaries into AnticiPay programs.
3. Each beneficiary receives a base streaming UBI.
4. Forecast oracles monitor disaster risk.
5. When risk increases, stream rates automatically boost.
6. Beneficiaries withdraw anytime to their wallet
7. Yellow Network settles balances efficiently on-chain.

The result is **continuous, adaptive financial protection**.

---

## 6. Example Scenario

A household in a flood-prone district:

* Normal: 300 NPR/day
* Forecast alert: 450 NPR/day
* Flood confirmed: 900 NPR/day
* Recovery phase: 360 NPR/day

Funds begin flowing before evacuation and continue throughout recovery, reducing reliance on emergency distributions.

---

## 7. Safeguards and Controls

To protect humanitarian funds, AnticiPay includes:

* Daily withdrawal limits
* Treasury reserve thresholds
* Oracle sanity checks
* Emergency pause mechanisms
* Inspector and operator overrides
* Budget caps per project

These controls balance automation with accountability.

## 8. Impact

AnticiPay delivers:

* Faster response times (seconds instead of days)
* Reduced asset loss before disasters
* Dignified, predictable support
* Lower operational costs
* Transparent public participation

It transforms aid from transactions into **financial infrastructure for resilience**.

---

## 9. Use Cases

* Flood and landslide-prone communities
* Heatwave protection programs
* Refugee and displacement camps
* Urban poverty safety nets
* Work-for-aid and learning-to-earn programs

---

## 11. Positioning

AnticiPay can be positioned as:

> A public, programmable, and anticipatory social protection layer that streams adaptive basic income and automatically increases support when disaster risk rises.

Or simply:

> AnticiPay turns humanitarian aid into a living financial lifeline.

## 12. Conclusion

AnticiPay reimagines humanitarian finance by combining crowdfunded treasuries, anticipatory action, and money streaming into a single adaptive system. Instead of waiting for disasters to strike, AnticiPay enables communities, donors, and technology to act early, continuously, and transparently.
